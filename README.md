This project involves detecting hand gestures using OpenCV and the CvZone library to facilitate sign language recognition. The script captures live hand gestures from a webcam, processes them by cropping the hand, resizing it to fit a defined image size, and then saving the gesture images to a specified folder. The project focuses on detecting one hand and converting its gestures into standard-sized images that can later be used for model training or further analysis.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SignLanguageHandDetection.git
cd SignLanguageHandDetection
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
Ensure that your webcam is properly set up and working.

Usage
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python hand_detection.py
Once the script starts, it will capture live video from the webcam.

The code tracks your hand and crops the region where the hand is located. It adjusts the image size to a 300x300 pixel format.

Press the s key to save the detected hand gesture image. The image will be saved in the folder path defined in the code (C:\\Users\\2005g\\OneDrive\\Documents\\python\\B).

The counter will increase each time a new image is saved, and the images will be saved with a timestamp.

Code Explanation
Hand Detection: The script uses cvzone.HandDetector to detect the hand in real time. It processes only one hand (maxHands=1).

Image Preprocessing: Once a hand is detected, the region around the hand is cropped and resized. The aspect ratio of the hand is maintained by resizing either the height or width first.

Cropping & Resizing: The hand image is resized to fit within a 300x300 pixel white canvas. Depending on the aspect ratio of the hand, the resized image is centered within this canvas.

Saving Images: By pressing the s key, the cropped and resized hand image is saved in the specified folder. Each image is named with a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous images.

Libraries Used
OpenCV (cv2): Used for capturing video, handling image processing tasks like cropping, resizing, and displaying the video feed.

CvZone: A library built on top of OpenCV for easier handling of hand tracking and other computer vision tasks.

NumPy: Used for creating and manipulating arrays. In this project, it helps create a blank white image (imgWhite) for placing the resized hand.

Future Enhancements
Multi-Hand Detection: Extend the functionality to detect and handle multiple hands.
Gesture Classification: Integrate a machine learning model to classify the detected hand gestures into corresponding sign language symbols.
Improved UI: Add a user-friendly interface that shows which sign the detected hand gesture represents.
